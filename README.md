When I was a kid we used to play a dice game called 10.000. 

You roll 6 dices. Keep the dices giving score. Decide if you want to roll the others, or if you want to stop and store/save the score. You can roll as many time as you want, as long as you get scores. However, if you don't get score in a roll, then you loose all your scores from that round. If you have score on all 6 dices, you get to roll all 6 again if you want to continue. First player to 10.000 scores wins.
